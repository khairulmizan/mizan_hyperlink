<h1>BEAUTIFUL SCENARY</h1>

<p>Tseeing and enjoying is a beautiful thing in our life, because seeing nature and enjoying is very beautiful, it could be happiness 
in our life, it really is a very beautiful nature if in enjoy, because an object if not see and enjoy we will not be able to, let alone 
reach to the very far away it never arrived, try if seen well and enjoy the right we can to high level, what else enjoy the beautiful 
scenery it must really see and feel what's happening in our hearts,</p>

<p>I think we all have a beautiful place in our mind. I have a wonderful place that made me happy a lot of times, years ago. But sometimes 
I think that I am the only person who likes this place and I'm asking myself if this place will be as beautiful as I thought when I will 
go back to visit it again. Perhaps I made it beautiful in my mind.</p>

<p>This place is meaningful to me because it is part of the county I loved, is part of the county where I grew up and is part of my childhood. 
This place is in the country in an old region named Appalachia, a small piece of the Appalachian Mountains, in a town named Pikeville.</p>
